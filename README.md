A small, responsive blog-card starter built for the devChallenges "Minimal Blog Card" challenge. Pure HTML & CSS with a simple, easy-to-customize layout.

**Suggested skills:** HTML, CSS

**Live preview:** open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.

**Quick Start**

- **Open locally:** double-click [index.html](index.html) to preview.
- **Start a local server:**
```bash
# from project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Features**
- **Responsive layout:** adapts for desktop and mobile via CSS media queries.
- **No JavaScript:** lightweight and easy to extend.
- **Customizable styles:** fonts and layout controlled in [style.css](style.css).
- **Assets included:** images and favicon live in [resources/](resources/).

**How to customize**
- **Content:** edit the card title, excerpt, tag, and author in [index.html](index.html).
- **Image:** replace `resources/Cactus.jpg` with your own image (keep the filename or update the path in the HTML).
- **Styling:** tweak variables and rules in [style.css](style.css) (font imported from Google Fonts).

**Project structure**
- **index.html:** main markup for the card.
- **style.css:** styles and responsive rules.
- **design/**: design reference files.
- **resources/**: images, favicon, and other assets.
- **README_template.md:** original template.

**What I changed / inferred**
- Implemented a centered card layout with variable-based radii and gaps in `style.css`.
- Imported the `Sora` font from Google Fonts.
- Added a background image at `resources/Cactus.jpg` and card visual styles.
- Added a small footer credit for author and challenge attribution in `index.html`.

If you made other edits (performance, accessibility, new assets, deploy steps), tell me and I'll add them here.
